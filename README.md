---|--------------------------|-------------------
1  | Shopping List            | 2025-09-13 12:00:00

$ ./notes view 1

$ ./notes edit 1 "Updated List" "Milk, eggs, bread, cheese"

$ ./notes delete 1

## Database

The application uses SQLite3 with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE notes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

The database file (`notes.db`) is created automatically in the current directory.

## Clean Build

To clean the build:

```bash
make clean
```
